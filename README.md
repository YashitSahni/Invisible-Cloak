# Invisible-Cloak
Itâ€™s the cloak that makes Harry Potter invisible. We will make this happen with few lines of python code in OpenCV.

As you would know that the cloak color was red. We have used red color in this program! 
This is simply a program that uses color segmentation and a bit of image processing to replace the foreground object of interest with the background.

# Dependencies

1.Python
2.Numpy
3.OpenCV

# Steps to be followed

1. Download the repository
2. Open background.py and run it and press 'q' to capture the image of the background
3. Open main.py and run it and see the magic all red color things will be gone
